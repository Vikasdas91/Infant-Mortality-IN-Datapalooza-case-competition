# Infant-Mortality-in-IN-Datapalooza-case-competition

Indiana has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the US with 7.2 deaths recorded per 1000 births in 2017.

With this staggering figure at hand the governor of Indiana, Eric Holcomb has set an ambitious goal to greatly reduce the Stateâ€™s infant mortality rate and achieve the lowest rate among Midwestern states by 2024. One step in achieving this target is the OB Navigator program, which is a collaborative effort between the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH), the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) and the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS).

OB Navigator program is essentially an outreach program which conducts awareness sessions for prospective mothers and provides healthcare to mothers at high risk. However, one of the biggest challenges faced by this program is to identify the most prone counties and highlight high-risk cases.

We were given access to the OB Navigator program data and we performed descriptive analytics and exploratory data analysis to highlight the most prone counties by highest mortality rates per capita. We also looked at the ethnicity and age group of mothers with past infant mortality cases to create a profile for high-risk mothers. We then created an XGBoost regression model taking into account demographic data of the mothers to determine the risk associated with prospective mothers in the state. For consumption of our solution, we created an RShiny app to dynamically process data and enable decision making.

Our solution was one of the top 5 finalists at the case competition and we got to present our solution to Indiana state representatives at Fort Wayne.
